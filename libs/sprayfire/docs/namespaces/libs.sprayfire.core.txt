/**
 * @namespace libs.sprayfire.core
 * @brief Holds parts of the framework that are considered essential for SprayFire
 * to operate.
 *
 * @details
 * The classes and interfaces in this namespace are generally things that work
 * with the file system, load classes and otherwise make sure the framework has
 * a common foundation to work with.  Ultimately you can almost think of this as
 * a "utility" namespace, but ultimately goes into the heart of the framework.
