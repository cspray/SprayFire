/** @mainpage
 *
 * SprayFire is a fully unit-tested, light-weight PHP framework for developers who
 * want to make simple, secure, dynamic website content.  Some of the features built
 * into SprayFire will include:
 *
 * - Full support of PHP 5.3+, most importantly including the use of namespaces
 * - Prepared statements for all CRUD functionality
 * - Automatic escaping of output on responses
 * - A simple but flexible templating system using built in PHP functionality
 * - An interface driven, fully extensible API allowing virtually any component of
 * the framework to be implemented at the application's needs
 * - A completely domain driven Model interpretation utilizing a custom-built data
 * persistence solution.
 * - Easy support for outside plugins and libraries that support PHP 5.3+.
 * - A reimagining of the normal "MVC" design pattern into something we here at SprayFire
 * like to call "MRC", or Model-Response-Controller.  Please check out the wiki for
 * more information on exactly how SprayFire interprets this design pattern.
